# Assignment_3-collab
This project is made for me and my friends to get some git / github collab experience.
I've made an outline for Assignment 3, with TODO's and some basic documentations for us to follow / mimic in the rest of the project. We should be able to easily finish this assignment using commits.

# Basic conduct
When making a commit.
* Write your name
* Write a short comment explaining what you've done
* Do not remove the TODO, instead change its content to explain what should be done next
* Leave work for other people to do. (Don't finish the whole assignment then commit it all at once)
