/**
 * Sheet 4 Question 6
 * <p>
 *     Write  a  class  named GroceryList that represents a personâ€™s list of items to buy from the market.
 * The GroceryList class has a list of grocery item orders and keeps track of its size (number of items in the list so far).
 * Assume that a grocery list will have no more than 10 items.
 * A GroceryList object should have the following methods and constructor:
 * public GroceryList() constructs a new empty grocery list.
 * public void add(GroceryltemOrder item) adds the given item order to this list, if the list is not full (i.e., has fewer than 10 items).
 * public double getTotalCost() returns the total sum cost of all grocery item orders in this list.
 * </p>
