/**
 * Sheet 4 question 4.
 * <p>
 *     Design  a  new Triangle class  that  extends  the  abstract GeometricObject class.
 * Draw  the  UML diagram for the classes Triangle and GeometricObject and then implement the Triangle class.
 * Write a  test  program  that  prompts  the  user  to  enter  three  sides  of  the  triangle,  a  color,  and  a Boolean value to indicate whether the triangle is filled.
 * The program should create a Triangle object with these sides and set the color and filled properties using the input.
 * The program should display the area, perimeter, color, and true or false to indicate whether it is filled or not.
 * </p>
